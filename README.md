# Environmental Policy Newsfeed & AI Summarization Tool

**Status**: _Work in Progress_

This repository hosts a prototype tool that gathers news and legislative updates about environmental policies—primarily focused on the Washington State Legislature—and uses AI to generate concise summaries. The goal is to keep everyone informed about new laws, proposed bills, and other important environmental policy actions without having to sift through multiple sources manually.

## Overview
With rapid changes in legislation and an ever-growing number of articles about environmental policy, it’s challenging to stay up-to-date. This tool aims to:
- Collect news articles and legislative updates related to environmental policies.
- Automatically summarize the key points and context for each item.
- Provide an easy-to-follow feed of important developments, focusing on Washington State legislative sessions.

Currently, the tool is in its early stages of development, but the core concept revolves around using AI summarization to quickly highlight bills in progress, proposed laws, or notable policy changes.

---

## Features
- **Automated News Gathering (WIP):** The system will eventually pull news articles, press releases, and legislative updates from various reliable sources.
- **AI Summaries:** Summaries are generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide quick overviews of lengthy or complex articles.
- **Environmental Policy Focus:** While the summarization technology can be applied to any domain, this project is specifically focused on environmental legislation and policy, with an emphasis on laws in progress at the Washington State Legislature.
- **Actionable Insights:** Summaries highlight potential impact, upcoming deadlines, key stakeholders, and possible next steps for activists, organizations, or concerned citizens.

---

## Technology Stack
- **Language Model:** A specialized AI summarization model (e.g., a GPT-based model) for extracting key details from articles.
- **Backend (planned):** Python-based service for ingesting and analyzing articles.
- **Database (planned):** A storage layer (e.g., PostgreSQL) to keep track of fetched articles, relevant metadata, and user preferences.
- **Frontend (planned):** A simple web or mobile interface to display curated summaries and enable search/filtering.

## How It Works
1. **Source Identification (Under Development)**
   - A list of trusted news providers, press release feeds, and the official Washington State Legislature website(s) will be polled for new content on environmental policies.

2. **Article Retrieval (Under Development)**
   - Articles and legislative updates are automatically fetched and stored for analysis.

3. **AI Summarization**
   - The system processes the raw text using a natural language model to distill lengthy reports into concise summaries. Summaries focus on:
     - The core legislative proposal or change.
     - Its potential impact on the environment and community.
     - Next steps in the legislative process (e.g., committee review, public hearing, voting session).

4. **User Notifications (Planned)**
   - The tool will be capable of sending periodic email digests or notifications highlighting new or updated legislative items based on user preferences.

5. **Review & Curation**
   - Summaries could be manually reviewed for accuracy and clarity during the development phase to ensure high-quality content.

## Roadmap
- **MVP Completion**:  
  - Implement a basic end-to-end pipeline that pulls a handful of test articles and summarizes them.
  - Provide a minimal web interface to display summaries.
  
- **Data Pipeline & Source Expansion**:  
  - Integrate multiple official and news sources.  
  - Automate fetching articles with scheduled tasks.

- **Improved Summaries & Personalization**:  
  - Fine-tune the summarization model for environmental policy jargon.  
  - Allow personalization based on the user’s specific interests (e.g., water regulation, clean energy, climate change legislation).

- **Notification System**:  
  - Implement scheduled email or SMS notifications.  
  - Let users subscribe to specific policy keywords or legislative bills.

- **Community Feedback & Collaboration**:  
  - Open up tools for feedback from policymakers, environmental experts, and the wider community.  
  - Encourage users to submit ideas for new features or additional coverage areas.
